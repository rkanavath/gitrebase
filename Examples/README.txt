OTB Examples Directory
----------------------

This directory contains simple, companion examples to the ORFEO
Toolbox (OTB). These examples are designed to demonstrate features of
the system; they are not meant to be significant applications of the
software (see the separate directory OTB-Applications for such
applications).

Specifically, the purpose of these examples is as follows:

   * Provide simple, minimalist examples of important features of OTB and how
     to use them. The examples have minimal dependencies on outside packages;
     and if they do, there should be CMake flags to turn them off.

   * Provide a consistent set of examples that will work in conjunctions with
     the OTB Software Guide.

   * Provide a consistent set of examples that will work with OTB tutorials
     and courses.

   * Make sure that the code is well documented, of consistent style, and
     always up-to-date with the current OTB code.

To learn the software from these examples, you may wish to refer to the
"ORFEO Toolbox Software Guide".
