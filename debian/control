Description: Free library of image processing algorithms - runtime
 ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) is distributed as an open source library of image
 processing algorithms. OTB is based on the medical image processing library
 ITK and offers particular functionalities for remote sensing image processing
 in general and for high spatial resolution images in particular. OTB is
 distributed under a free software license CeCILL (similar to GNU GPL) to
 encourage contribution from users and to promote reproducible research.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries required by Monteverdi,
 Monteverdi2 and the OTB applications.
