Comment: The files in Modules/ThirdParty/ITK/include/ are pending patches
 to ITK upstream which were rejected by ITK as the changes are
 irrelevant in their point of view. Hence upstream source is repacked and
 kept under the same ITK license from which these files are derived.

 CeCILL FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
 .
     Notice
 .
 This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
 of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
 the two main principles guiding its drafting:
 .
     * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
       of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to
       users,
     * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which
       it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
       intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
       both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.
 .
 The authors of the CeCILL (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[ogiciel] L[ibre])
 license are:
 .
 Commissariat  l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical
 and industrial research establishment, having its principal place of
 business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.
 .
 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific
 and technological establishment, having its principal place of business

 .
 .
     Preamble
 .
 The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
 the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
 license within the framework of an open source distribution model.
 .
 The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations
 for users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.
 .
 In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
 modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
 with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
 economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
 .
 In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
 and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
 the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
 complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
 developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
 knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
 suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
 enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
 more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
 security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
 provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
 removed herefrom.
 .
 This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
 the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.
 .
 .
     Article 1 - DEFINITIONS

 Software: means the software in its Object Code and/or Source Code form
 and, where applicable, its documentation, "as is" when the Licensee
 accepts the Agreement.
 .
 Initial Software: means the Software in its Source Code and possibly its
 Object Code form and, where applicable, its documentation, "as is" when
 it is first distributed under the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
 .
 Modified Software: means the Software modified by at least one
 Contribution.
 .
 Source Code: means all the Software's instructions and program lines to
 which access is required so as to modify the Software.
 .
 Object Code: means the binary files originating from the compilation of
 the Source Code.
 .
 Holder: means the holder(s) of the economic rights over the Initial
 Software.
 .
 Licensee: means the Software user(s) having accepted the Agreement.
 .
 Contributor: means a Licensee having made at least one Contribution.

 Contribution: means any or all modifications, corrections, translations,
 adaptations and/or new functions integrated into the Software by any or
 all Contributors, as well as any or all Internal Modules.
 .
 Module: means a set of sources files including their documentation that
 enables supplementary functions or services in addition to those offered
 by the Software.
 .
 External Module: means any or all Modules, not derived from the
 Software, so that this Module and the Software run in separate address
 spaces, with one calling the other when they are run.
 .
 Internal Module: means any or all Module, connected to the Software so
 that they both execute in the same address space.
 .
 GNU GPL: means the GNU General Public License version 2 or any
 subsequent version, as published by the Free Software Foundation Inc.

     Article 9 - WARRANTY
 .
 9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical

 possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
 possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
 attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
 modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
 reserved for experienced users.
 .
 The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
 the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
 order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
 or properties.
 .
 9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
 to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
 rights set forth in Article 5).
 .
 9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
 the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
 that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty
 as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant
 nature.
 .
 Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
 from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
 be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
 configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.

 relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
 the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
 arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
 instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
 Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
 the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
 assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be
 decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
 Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
 disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the
 name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
 prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
 of a trademark.

 functioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications
 networks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by
 government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,
 fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.

 11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke
 one or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be

 invoke said provision(s) subsequently.
 .
 11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements,
 whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same
 purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said
 Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the
 terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties
 unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized
 representatives.
 .
 11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to
 conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text,
 said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make
 the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative
 text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity
 of a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not
 cause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid.
